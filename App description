This app is a sequel to the side scrolling Paper Ninja game. However the game has traded the side scrolling for a fun arcade style game where the ninja throws darts on either side at the robots. This game is very simple to play as you press the buttons on either side in order to shoot. The longer you shoot the faster the enemies get. There is no escape how long can you last?
